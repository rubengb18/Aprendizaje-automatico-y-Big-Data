simpleza del problema. Por esta razón, los resultados tanto en validación como en test son muy buenos independientemente de los valores de los parámetros utilizados. \n","En el caso de tener un problema más complejo, los parámetros afectarían de la siguiente manera:\n","\n","*  learning_rate: un learning rate bajo hace que el modelo aprenda más despacio, ajustandose en menor medida a los datos de entrenamiento, evitando así el overfitting.\n","*  max_depth: cuanto más profundo es el árbol, más se produce overfitting en el modelo. Esto se debe a que se crearán hojas con pocos ejemplos pero muy ajustados a ellos, por lo que no se generaliza.\n","*  n_estimators: cuanto más árboles se usen en el modelo, se producirá más overfitting al ajustarse demasiado a los datos de entrenamiento. Además aumentará considerablemente el tiempo de entrenamiento.\n","*  subsample: cuanto mayor sea esta proporción, más sobreaprende el modelo, ya que usrá cada vez más instancias de los datos de entrenamiento.\n","*  colsample_bytree: cuantas más columnas sean tomadas en cuenta en el modelo, mayor será el ajuste de este a los datos de entrenamiento.\n","\n","El objetivo es encontrar los valores de los parámetros que eviten el overfitting pero que produzcan buenos resultados en el conjunto de validación, comprobando así que no se ha generalizado demasiado."],"metadata":{"id":"W4sZYyYGP8Gc"}}]}
